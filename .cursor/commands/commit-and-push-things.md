Run ts-check and fix whatever comes up. Then commit using conventional commits. You can do one commit or multiple, depending on the content of the changes. Then push.

Files modified in the `desktop/` folder must be committed separately from the `server/` folder.

Prefix commits with `[desktop]` or `[server]` depending on the folder that was modified.
